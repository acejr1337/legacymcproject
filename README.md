Minecraft's old launchers reunified once again using new authentication methods.

When I first played the game I remeber seeing the launcher that had a simple username/password field at the bottom with the minecraft logo on the left
and a news feed window above and this was the launcher I used right up until 1.6 when the version changing feature was added and then a few years later
Minecraft decides to recode their Launcher in C++ and it became almost disgusting in my opinion in terms of the look and feel.


What is this project?

Well recently I saw that Microsoft was going to remove complete support for their Legacy launchers rendering them useless by removing the Mojang authentication servers.
As of the time of writing this (1/2/2022) they're still online but within due time they no longer will be online.

I took the initative to aid the old and bring back the original launchers.

The original launcher, the slightly newer launcher that I remember using, and the slightly slightly newer launcher with version changing.

I did this by changing the old authentication methods to authenticate with Microsoft's new authentication servers.

For people who are still Mojang users well I got good news for you.
while the mojang servers are still online (but won't be forever) I have added support for mojang servers.

It first tries to log you in using Microsoft and if that fails it will try Mojang.

This way when mojang ends up shutting their doors for good Microsoft users won't have to wait for the Mojang authentication checks first they can just jump straight in and play.

Is this legal?

I'm not a lawyer by any means but I haven't released any cracked software,
You must authenticate with your genuine Microsoft' Minecraft account and to do that you must own a Microsoft account with Minecraft purchased (from Microsoft) on it.

If you do not have this then you can not play, simple!
